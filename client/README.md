## ☕ The Coffee Bean Journey: From Soil to Sip

### 🌱 06:00 AM – “Rooted in Rich Soil”
**Stage: Plant & Grow**  
In the misty highlands, coffee seedlings are nurtured in fertile volcanic soil. Farmers carefully select heirloom varieties, ensuring each plant is primed for flavor and resilience. Over months, these grow into lush shrubs bearing ruby-red cherries — nature’s promise of aroma.

### 🍒 08:30 AM – “Harvesting the Ruby Gems”
**Stage: Harvest**  
At sunrise, skilled hands pick only the ripest cherries, one by one. This selective harvesting ensures peak sweetness and complexity. The air is filled with earthy scents and the soft rustle of leaves — a ritual passed down through generations.

---

### 🧺 10:00 AM – “Sun-Kissed Transformation”
**Stage: Processing**  
Cherries are spread across raised beds to dry under the sun. This natural process — known as the **dry method** — intensifies fruity notes. Workers gently turn the cherries to avoid fermentation, preserving clarity and balance in the cup.

---

### 🌞 01:00 PM – “Drying with Precision”
**Stage: Drying**  
After days of sun exposure, the cherries reach optimal moisture levels. They’re collected into woven baskets, their skins now leathery and aromatic. This stage locks in the bean’s character — floral, nutty, or citrusy — depending on origin.

---

### 🏗️ 03:30 PM – “Milling the Magic”
**Stage: Milling**  
Inside rustic mills, dried cherries are hulled to reveal green beans. These are sorted by size, density, and color using gravity tables and optical scanners. The result? A batch of pristine beans ready for the final metamorphosis.

---

### 🔥 05:00 PM – “The Roast Awakening”
**Stage: Roasting**  
Beans tumble in rotating drums, kissed by heat. As they crack and caramelize, their flavors bloom — chocolate, spice, berry, smoke. Roasters monitor temperature curves like composers tuning a symphony. This is where science meets soul.

---

### 🛍️ 06:30 PM – “Packed with Purpose”
**Bonus Stage: Packaging & Distribution**  
Freshly roasted beans are sealed in aroma-lock bags, labeled with roast date and origin. They’re shipped to cafés, homes, and connoisseurs worldwide. Every bag tells a story — of soil, sweat, and sensory delight.

---

### 🌍 08:00 PM – “From Farm to Cup”
**Final Moment: Brewing & Savoring**  
Whether it’s a pour-over in Nairobi or an espresso in Berlin, the journey culminates in a single sip. Balanced acidity, velvety body, lingering finish — all echo the care behind every step.
